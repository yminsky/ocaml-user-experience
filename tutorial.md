# Fantasty Tutorial

This section includes the tutorial we wish we could write for the
OCaml tools.  Still very much in development.

## Preliminaries

Before starting the tutorial proper, what are the steps we want the
tutorial to cover?

### Setup/initializaion

- Should cover common use-cases
- Maybe: Linux (e.g., on a VM), Mac, locally, and Windows, via WSL2.
- Install basic tools
- We could "cheat" and do it via containers, i.e., get them to install
  Docker first.
  - But the container is hiding complexity of the underlying tools in
    a way that's going to come out when someone needs to write their
    own docker setup, or to do a local install. So there's a real
    tradeoff here.
