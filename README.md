# Notes on the OCaml Developer Experience

Various notes on what would make for a great developer experience for
OCaml.  Much of this is distilled from our experiences on working on
[Real World OCaml](https://realworldocaml.org), which has had thousands
of feedback comments over the past decade.  V2 of RWO includes a chapter
on tooling and developer experience, and we'd like to make the onboarding
experience for readers of that book as smooth as possible.
